# Graduation Project Frontend - Wassilni

## Main Idea: 
The project aims to streamline the process of finding rides between cities and villages in Palestine. By connecting drivers and passengers, it aims to reduce the time spent on transportation, especially for those who travel frequently. 
The app supports three types of users: drivers, passengers, and admin.

## Key features:

1- Authentication using JWT.
2- Authorization with different privileges for each user type.
3- Publishing rides (for drivers only) by setting the rideâ€™s origin and destination points, selecting the path of the ride, date, time, number of seats and properties of the ride, and the driver also chooses whether passengers can reserve seats instantly or by sending requests to him. 
4- Passengers can search for rides, sort results by closest to origin/destination, filter results by properties/time.
5- Report and Rating Systems.
In addition to these features, Chatting, Cancel Reservations/ Delete Rides, Notifications and more features were implemented.
